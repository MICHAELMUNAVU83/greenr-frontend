## About The App
  This is a carbon credit trading platform. It is built with React JS
            and Bootstrap CSS. It has a backend built with Ruby on Rails. It has
            a user authentication system and has access to buyers and sellers.
            It allows users to buy and sell carbon credits to reduce their
            carbon footprint.
